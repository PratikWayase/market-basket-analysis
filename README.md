 association rules for market basket analysis:

Antecedents :

they are the "if" items that start a rule, while consequents are the "then" items that tend to be purchased along with them.

Support:
 measures how often a combination of items appears together in transactions.

Confidence:
 tells you the probability of buying the consequent item when the antecedent is already in the basket.

Lift:
 reveals the strength of the association between items, considering their independent purchase probabilities. A lift greater than 1 suggests a positive association, meaning they're more likely to be bought together.
